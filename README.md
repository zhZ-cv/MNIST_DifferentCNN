# MNIST_DifferentCNN

## This is a project to use some different CNN to train the MNIST, quantize model, and try to find a model that has a small memory usage and high accuracy

* MNISTEvaluation.py is a GUI, you can use it to test the training CNN easily

* ModelTrain.py is used to train the CNN

* MyModel_0.py and MyModel_1.py are different CNN. I have trained some other models, but the accuracy is not good.
Therefore, I delete all of them. You can design your own model, and train it. Hope you can get some better models.

* QATModel.py is a file to quantize the tained CNN, also you can use it to write parameters to txt in the form of eight-bit complement
